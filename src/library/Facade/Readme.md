The Facade Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

A facade is an object that provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code, such as a class library. A facade can:
    make a software library easier to use, understand and test, since the facade has convenient methods for common tasks;
    make the library more readable, for the same reason;
    reduce dependencies of outside code on the inner workings of a library, since most code uses the facade, thus allowing more flexibility in developing the system;
    wrap a poorly designed collection of APIs with a single well-designed API.
